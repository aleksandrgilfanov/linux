description: |
  HTE properties should be named "hardware-timestamps". The exact meaning of
  each hardware-timestamps property must be documented in the device tree
  binding for each device. An optional property "hardware-timestamp-names" may
  contain a list of strings to label each of the HTE devices listed in the
  "hardware-timestamps" property.

  The "hardware-timestamp-names" property if specified is used to map the name
  of the HTE device requested by the devm_of_hte_request_ts() call to an index
  into the list given by the "hardware-timestamps" property.

properties:
  hardware-timestamps:
