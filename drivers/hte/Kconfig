          Hardware Timestamping Engine (HTE) Support.

          Some devices provide hardware timestamping engine which can timestamp
	  certain device lines/signals in realtime. This way to provide
	  hardware assisted timestamp to generic signals like GPIOs, IRQs lines
	  comes with benefit for the applications like autonomous machines
	  needing accurate timestamping event with less jitter.

	  This framework provides a generic interface to such HTE devices
          within the Linux kernel. It provides an API to register and
	  unregister a HTE provider chip, configurable sw buffer to
	  store the timestamps, push the timestamp from the HTE providers and
	  retrieve timestamps for the consumers. It also provides means for the
	  consumers to request signals it wishes to hardware timestamp and
	  release them if not required.

          If unsure, say no.

	  Enable this option for integrated hardware timestamping engine also
	  known as generic timestamping engine (GTE) support on NVIDIA Tegra194
	  systems-on-chip. The driver supports 352 LIC IRQs and 39 AON GPIOs
	  lines for timestamping in realtime.
